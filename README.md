callfire-ivr-samples
====================

This page constitutes a repository of CallFire XML samples that can be used to create an inbound or outbound IVR.

Getting Started
The IVR examples presented here assume that the user has a basic understanding of the XML mark-up language, a basic outline of which is available on the CallFire help page: https://www.callfire.com/help/docs/callfire-xml.

In each of the folders above, you will find sample IVRs written in CallFire XML, along with a description of what each IVR is designed to do, along with a real-world usage scenario, when applicable.
